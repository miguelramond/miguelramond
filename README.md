# Hey, I'm Miguel, but everyone calls me Mike.

I have a law degree, however most of my work has been in the fast-paced, team oriented, always moving film and advertising industry.

I decided to take up an old hobby of mine, and get a glimpse of the software development world. 
I'm currently learning the ropes in Java Software Development, and OOP in general.

Here, you can find some stuff I've been working on, all the while I keep honing my skills and knowledge.
